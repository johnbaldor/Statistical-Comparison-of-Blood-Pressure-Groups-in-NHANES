This project involves analyzing the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) dataset, focusing on adults aged 18 and above. The primary goal is to explore the weights of individuals with different systolic blood pressure classifications, specifically "PreHypertension" (systolic blood pressure between 120 and 140). The analysis includes calculating the 90% confidence interval for the mean weight of people with "PreHypertension" using both manual calculations and built-in R functions.


Output

The script provides the lower and upper bounds of the 90% confidence interval for the mean weight of adults classified with "PreHypertension."
It also uses the t.test() function to calculate the same confidence interval, verifying the manual calculation.
